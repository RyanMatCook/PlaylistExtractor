Extracts Windows Media Player 12 Playlist Songs from the playlist file to a destination folder


I wanted to be able to copy all of the songs in my Windows Media Player playlist into a destination folder so that I could copy them on to my phone.

I wrote this tiny app to do that. 

Runs on Windows - Put the executables in the release folder, just run the exe or you can build it yourself and run that exe.
